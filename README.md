# Plex Discord Theater

A Discord Activity that lets you browse your Plex library and watch movies and TV shows together in a voice channel — synchronized playback, host controls, and all streamed through Discord.

## Features

- **Browse your Plex library** — movies and TV shows with search, genre filters, and sorting
- **Synchronized playback** — the host controls play/pause/seek and all viewers stay in sync
- **Audio & subtitle selection** — pick audio tracks and subtitles before playing
- **VPS relay** — optional nginx caching proxy offloads segment delivery to a VPS with 1 Gbps, so your home upload isn't the bottleneck
- **Segment pre-fetching** — server proactively fetches segments from Plex ahead of playback, eliminating throttle-related buffering at cold start
- **P2P segment sharing** — when no VPS is configured, viewers share HLS segments with each other via WebRTC, reducing server bandwidth
- **Automatic host promotion** — if the host leaves, the next viewer is promoted so the session continues
- **Thumbnail caching** — artwork is cached server-side in SQLite for fast browsing
- **Persistent sessions** — sessions and host roles survive server restarts (SQLite-backed)
- **Secure** — your Plex token never leaves the server; the backend proxies everything

## How It Works

```
Discord Voice Channel
  └─ Activity (iframe)
       └─ React client (hls.js)
            ├─ VPS relay (nginx cache) — when configured
            ├─ OR: WebRTC ↔ other viewers (P2P segment sharing) — fallback
            └─ Express backend (WebSocket sync + API proxy + segment pre-fetch cache)
                 └─ Plex Media Server (HLS transcoding)
```

The first user to join becomes the host and can browse the library and start playback. Everyone else watches in sync via WebSocket. The backend proxies all Plex API calls and HLS video segments so nothing is exposed directly to clients.

### VPS Relay (Recommended)

When `VPS_RELAY_URL` is configured, HLS segments are served through a VPS with nginx caching instead of directly from your home server. Your Plex server transcodes once and uploads one stream to the VPS — the VPS then fans it out to all viewers from its 1 Gbps connection.

```
Without VPS:  Home upload = N viewers × bitrate (bottleneck)
With VPS:     Home upload = 1 stream to VPS (~8-12 Mbps), VPS handles the rest
```

This is the recommended setup for watch parties with more than a few viewers. P2P is automatically disabled when VPS relay is active. See [VPS Relay Setup](#vps-relay-optional) below and [docs/vps-relay-setup.md](docs/vps-relay-setup.md) for the full guide.

### Segment Pre-Fetching

The server proactively fetches HLS segments from Plex into an in-memory cache before viewers request them. This eliminates the ~30-second throttle gap that Plex imposes on HTTP segment delivery at the start of a new transcode session.

How it works:
- After starting a transcode, the server polls the HLS sub-manifest every 2 seconds to discover available segments
- 3 concurrent workers fetch discovered segments from Plex and cache them in memory
- When the VPS (or a viewer) requests a segment, Express serves it instantly from cache
- Cache miss falls through to on-demand Plex fetch (existing behavior)
- Supports up to 2 concurrent watch party sessions
- Memory-bounded: max 100 segments per session (~300 MB at 8 Mbps), with eviction prioritizing already-served segments

Combined with timeline updates (which tell Plex the client's playback position), this ensures smooth playback from the very first second.

### P2P Segment Sharing (Fallback)

When no VPS is configured, viewers in the same watch session automatically form a peer-to-peer mesh using WebRTC. When one viewer downloads an HLS segment from the server, they share it directly with other viewers — so the same segment doesn't need to be fetched from Plex multiple times.

- **BitTorrent tracker** — the server runs an embedded [bittorrent-tracker](https://github.com/webtorrent/bittorrent-tracker) over WebSocket for peer discovery and signaling
- **Swarm per session** — viewers watching the same content share a swarm ID, so P2P only happens within a watch session
- **Transparent fallback** — if a segment isn't available from peers in time, it falls back to fetching from the server normally
- **Tuned for live-ish playback** — P2P prefetch window of 30s with 6s HTTP window and 2 concurrent HTTP downloads, so peers have time to supply segments before the client fetches them directly
- **NAT traversal** — uses a STUN server for WebRTC connections behind NAT

P2P reduces bandwidth when multiple people are watching together, but is limited by the host's upload speed. For larger watch parties, the VPS relay is a better solution.

### Transcode Configuration

The server requests HLS transcoding from Plex with these settings:

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Video codec | H.264 | Universal browser compatibility |
| Audio codec | AAC (forced) | Browser-compatible; prevents Plex falling back to MP3 |
| Max resolution | 1920×1080 | Good quality without excessive bandwidth |
| Target bitrate | 8 Mbps (peak 12 Mbps) | Balances quality and bandwidth |
| Segment duration | 3 seconds | Faster cold start — Plex only needs to transcode 3s before the first segment is ready |
| Location | LAN | Treats the connection as local to avoid WAN throttling |
| Direct stream audio | Disabled | Forces audio transcode to AAC for consistent browser playback |

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Client | React, hls.js, [p2p-media-loader](https://github.com/nicedoc/p2p-media-loader), Discord Embedded App SDK |
| Server | Express, WebSocket (ws), bittorrent-tracker, better-sqlite3 |
| Streaming | HLS via Plex transcoder, server-side segment pre-fetch cache, WebRTC P2P sharing |
| Infrastructure | Docker, Node.js 22, optional nginx VPS relay |

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+** (or Docker)
- **A Plex Media Server** accessible from the machine running the backend
- **A Discord application** with Activities enabled
- **A public HTTPS URL** pointing to the backend (for Discord's iframe proxy)

## Setup

### 1. Discord Developer Portal

1. Go to [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application
2. Go to **Activities > Settings** and enable Activities
3. Add a URL mapping: `/` → your server's public URL
4. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 2. Get Your Plex Token

Find your token by opening Plex Web, playing any media, then checking the Network tab in DevTools for `X-Plex-Token=` in query parameters. Or follow the [official Plex guide](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/).

### 3. Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your values:

```env
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_discord_client_secret
PLEX_URL=http://localhost:32400
PLEX_TOKEN=your_plex_token
PORT=3000
REDIRECT_URI=https://your-public-url.example.com
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-public-url.example.com

# Optional — VPS relay (see "VPS Relay Setup" section below)
# VPS_RELAY_URL=https://theater.yourdomain.com
# VPS_RELAY_KEY=your-secret-key
```

For local development, also create `packages/client/.env`:

```env
VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
```

### 4. Run

#### Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

#### Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts both services concurrently:

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Server  | `http://localhost:3000` | Express API + WebSocket |
| Client  | `http://localhost:5173` | Vite dev server (proxies `/api` to server) |

#### Tunnel for Discord

Discord Activities require a public HTTPS URL. For local dev, use [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/):

```bash
brew install cloudflared
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5173
```

Set the resulting `https://xxxx.trycloudflare.com` URL as the URL mapping in your Discord app's Activities settings.

> **Note:** The tunnel URL changes every restart. Use a [named tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-local-tunnel/) for a stable URL.

### 5. Deploy

Build and push the Docker image:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Then on your server (e.g. Unraid):

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

### 6. Launch

1. Join a voice channel in Discord
2. Click the **Activities** (rocket) icon
3. Select your app — the Activity loads and you'll see the Plex library

## VPS Relay (Optional)

Route HLS segments through a VPS (~$7/mo) to offload upload bandwidth from your home server during watch parties. Your home uploads one stream to the VPS; the VPS fans it out to all viewers from its 1 Gbps connection.

### Why

If your home upload is 100 Mb/s and you're running a watch party with 10 viewers at 8 Mbps, that's 80 Mb/s — leaving almost nothing for other Plex users. With the VPS relay, home upload drops to ~8 Mb/s regardless of viewer count.

### Quick Setup Overview

1. **Create a Hetzner VPS** (CAX11 or CX23) at [hetzner.com/cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) — Primary IPv4, Ubuntu 24.04
2. **Install nginx + certbot** and set up SSL for `theater.yourdomain.com`
3. **Add Discord URL Mapping** — `/theater` → `theater.yourdomain.com` in Discord Developer Portal → Activities → URL Mappings
4. **Add Cloudflare IP Access Rule** (if your Express domain uses Cloudflare) — whitelist VPS IP to bypass Bot Fight Mode
5. **Configure nginx** to proxy through Express (not directly to Plex — Plex throttles external delivery)
6. **Add env vars** to `.env`:
   ```env
   VPS_RELAY_URL=https://theater.yourdomain.com
   VPS_RELAY_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```
   Generate key: `openssl rand -hex 32`

See **[docs/vps-relay-setup.md](docs/vps-relay-setup.md)** for the complete nginx config and step-by-step instructions.

### How It Works

When `VPS_RELAY_URL` and `VPS_RELAY_KEY` are set:
- `.ts` segment URLs in HLS manifests are rewritten to `/theater/seg/...` (relative, via Discord's proxy to VPS)
- VPS nginx validates `?key=`, rewrites to `/api/plex/hls/seg?p=...`, proxies to your Express server
- Express checks the segment pre-fetch cache first — if the segment was already fetched ahead of time, it's served instantly
- On cache miss, Express fetches the segment from Plex locally (unthrottled) and returns it
- VPS caches the segment for 5 minutes — subsequent viewers get it instantly from cache
- P2P is automatically disabled (VPS handles fan-out)

Sub-manifests stay on Express for correct URL rewriting. Do NOT proxy directly to Plex:32400 — Plex throttles external HTTP delivery to 1x realtime, causing stuttering.

When env vars are removed, everything reverts to Express proxying with P2P.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `VPS_RELAY_URL` | No | VPS relay URL (e.g. `https://theater.yourdomain.com`). Omit to disable. |
| `VPS_RELAY_KEY` | No | Shared secret validated by nginx. Must match the key in the nginx config. |

Both must be set to activate. If either is missing, falls back to direct Express proxying with P2P.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Failed to connect to Discord" | Make sure you're launching as a Discord Activity from a voice channel, not visiting the URL directly |
| Library is empty | Check that `PLEX_URL` and `PLEX_TOKEN` are correct and the server can reach Plex |
| Video won't play | Check browser console for HLS errors; ensure Plex can transcode |
| "Session expired" banner | The server restarted and your session is stale — close and reopen the Activity |
| Tunnel URL changed | Update the URL mapping in Discord Developer Portal |
| Audio is MP3 instead of AAC | Redeploy — the server now forces AAC via `directStreamAudio=0` and an audio codec limitation |
| VPS segments return 403 | Key mismatch — check `VPS_RELAY_KEY` in `.env` matches the key in nginx config |
| VPS segments return 403 (Cloudflare) | Cloudflare blocking VPS — add IP Access Rule to whitelist VPS IP (not WAF Skip rule) |
| VPS segments return 502 | VPS can't reach Express server — check Cloudflare IP Access Rule exists, Express domain DNS resolves |
| VPS causes stuttering | Proxying directly to Plex:32400 — must proxy through Express instead (see docs) |
| Segments blocked in Discord | Missing URL mapping — add `/theater → theater.yourdomain.com` in Discord Dev Portal |
